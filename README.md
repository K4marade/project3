Installation
------------

If you\'re on MacOS, you can install Pipenv easily with Homebrew:

    $ brew install pipenv

Or, if you\'re using Fedora 28:

    $ sudo dnf install pipenv

Otherwise, refer to the [documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) for instructions.

Once you installed pipenv, clone project repository and install from Pipfile:

    $ pipenv install

Next, activate the Pipenv shell:

    $ pipenv shell

This will spawn a new shell subprocess, which can be deactivated by using exit.
